1 - Mathematical Operators

2 - List, Tuples or Dictionaries ?

  First, List and tuplea are almost the same thing. The difference betewwen each order is that list are mutable while tuples are not.
  In other words, instead of tuples, you can change a element inside of a list.
  There are diferences in the each structure too. List uses the parenthesis while tuples uses brackets.
  
  For example:
  
  >>>> Changing a list:
  
list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
print(lista)
[0, 1, 2, 3]
list[0] = 1
print(list)
[9, 1, 2, 3]

  >>>> Changing a tuple:
  
tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3)
print(tupla)
(0, 1, 2, 3)
tuple[0] = 1
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

 Dictionaries: Dictionaries are one way to overcome the list limits as the fact that the elemets are independents of each other. 
 With dicionary, the entire collection of data in which a key is stored has a corresponding value just lika a dictionary in real life.
 
 
3 - Methods & Objetcs

  Everthing in python is a objetc.
  a method is a function that "belongs" to an object
  
4 - TXT, CSV and JASON files: What is the differrence?
  TXT = A txt file is a simple file with no formartting such as bold,italic or different fonts. They are universal an can be read in any device or operating system. 
  
  CSV (Comma Separeted Value) = As the name says, CSV is a file where the data is separeted by comma. They are similiar  TXT.
  
  JASON (Java Script Ojetc Notation) = It is a simple data format that is used to transmit information in web application. This kind of file is like a dictionay 
  structere in python.
