2 - List, Tuples or Dictionaries ?

  First, List and tuplea are almost the same thing. The difference betewwen each order is that list are mutable while tuples are not.
  In other words, instead of tuples, you can change a element inside of a list.
  There are diferences in the each structure too. List uses the parenthesis while tuples uses brackets.
  
  For example:
  
  >>>> Changing a list:
  
list = [0, 1, 2, 3]
print(lista)
[0, 1, 2, 3]
list[0] = 1
print(list)
[9, 1, 2, 3]

  >>>> Changing a tuple:
  
tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3)
print(tupla)
(0, 1, 2, 3)
tuple[0] = 1
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

 Dictionaries: Dictionaries are one way to overcome the list limits as the fact that the elemets are independents of each other. 
 With dicionary, the entire collection of data in which a key is stored has a corresponding value just lika a dictionary in real life.
